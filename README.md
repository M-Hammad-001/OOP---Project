This Car Rental System is a Java-based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project that I developed in my second semester. It is designed to efficiently manage car rentals, allowing users to book cars while providing an easy-to-use interface for administrators to manage vehicles, customers, and bookings.

ðŸ”¹ Features & Functionalities:
âœ… User Registration & Login â€“ Secure authentication for customers and admins.
âœ… Car Management â€“ Add, update, and remove cars from the system.
âœ… Booking System â€“ Customers can rent available cars based on their preferences.
âœ… Rental Pricing Calculation â€“ Automated cost calculation based on rental duration.
âœ… OOP Principles Implementation â€“ Uses Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction for clean and modular code.
âœ… File Handling & Data Storage â€“ Stores user and rental data using text files or databases.
âœ… Error Handling & Validations â€“ Ensures smooth user interactions with proper exception handling.

This project was a great learning experience in implementing real-world OOP concepts, improving problem-solving skills, and understanding the logic behind car rental systems. ðŸš€
